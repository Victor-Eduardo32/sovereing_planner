## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
- Node (version 20 or higher)

### ‚öíÔ∏è Installation Guide

This guide assumes that you already know how to install all the listed prerequisites.

Install the `node_modules` dependencies in the front-end:
```
cd front-end
npm i
```
Install the `node_modules` dependencies in the back-end:
```
cd back-end
npm i
```

Then, create you `.env` from the [`.env.example`](.env.example).

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the following environment variable with your PostgreSQL details:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:{PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/{DATABASE}?schema={SCHEMA_NAME}"
```

Replace `{PASSWORD}`, `{DATABASE}`, and `{SCHEMA_NAME}` with the appropriate values in the connection string. If you are using a different connection user, change `postgres` to the one you commonly use.

**Remember:** All the above data refers to your personal postgres configuration, so make sure all the data is correct.

If you do not yet have a `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in your `.env`, it is recommended to set a value for the field. It is possible to use it without setting a value, but it may cause some issues with authentication.

And if your database does not yet have the tables, just run the migrations:
```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

If the database does not exist, it will be created automatically.

Now just start the API:

```
npm run dev
```

Then, start the vue:

```
cd front-end
npx quasar dev
```

And that's it, you can now use the application normally at: [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).
